# Nightmare
A game in which the player controls someone having a nightmare. They are trying to wake up without dying in their dream. If they get too scared, wake up and the player will lose. The player must avoid anything scary (evil animate slime balls, darkness, etc) and make it to the light at the end of the level. Created for a college course.
